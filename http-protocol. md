## What is **HTTP** ?
HTTP is a protcol built upon TCP/IP (plain ASCII text lines) being sent by the client to a server to request a particular action and then the server replies a 
few text lines before the actual requested content is sent to the client.

> The client, curl, sends a HTTP request. The request contains a method (like GET, POST, HEAD etc), 
> a number of request headers and sometimes a request body. The HTTP server responds with a status line (indicating if things went well), 
> response headers and most often also a response body. The "body" part is the plain data you requested, 
> like the actual HTML or the image etc.
