## Welcome to Jacranda's Blog

I just graduated with a Master degree in IT at the end of 2018 and started my career in the IT industry of Australia from Febrary of 2019. I found myself the beginner of the beginner of coding but I did not lose confidence. 

The purpose of this blog is to track the practices I performed on my way of self-evolution and record the progress I gained during this journey. I would appreciate it if you would like to give me some suggestions and advice.

## How to setup your personal blog using Github Pages?

* Create a new repository named {your_username}.github.io and that's all. This URL will be the default Github Page URL for you.
* If you create the repository using other name, it would be just a normal project not a Github Page.
